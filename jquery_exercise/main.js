/*Create a Checklist: Independent Practice

You'll add the ability to complete tasks in the list. Your program must complete the following rules:

- Through jQuery add a "complete task" link at the end of each to-do item.
- When clicked, the link will cross out the current task (hint: add a class to the list that sets the text-decoration to strikeout).
- Each new task added by the user needs to also have the "complete task" link akt the end.
- Bonus: when user completes task, remove the task from the current list and add it to a completed list below. Do not show this list unless the there are completed items.
- Bonus 2: add the ability to restore items from the completed list to the first list.

// 1. create a form and a button that will add onto the existing list
// 2. add a checkbox next to each list items
// 3. make the checkbox checkable with crossout
